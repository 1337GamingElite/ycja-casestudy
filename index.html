    <h1>The SITUATION - #3</h1>
    <p class="bginfo">When Mark got his driver's license, he could not wait to take his friends out for a drive. On a Saturday evening, Mark and a group of his friends piled into a car and headed out from Edmonton toward Sherwood Park. When the vehicle pulled up to a stoplight, a sports car filled with another group of teens pulled up alongside. As both drivers waited for the light to turn green, the sports car accelerated quickly. Not to be outdone, Mark stepped on the gas and, with squealing tires, his car followed in hot pursuit. The two cars sped down the road, reaching speeds well above the speed limit. Swerving to avoid a collision, Mark's car hit the curb, flew across a lawn, and smashed into the front of a house.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="bginfo">Luckily, Mark and his friends recieved only minor injuries; however, the front end of the car he was driving was destroyed and the house suffered several thousands of dollars in damage.</p>

    <p class="info">Key details of the crime:
    <ul class="info" style="margin-left: 50px;">
        <li>Location: Edmonton (near an intersection on the way to Sherwood Park)</li>
        <li>Perpetrator: Mark (recently acquired a drivers license)</li>
        <li>Crime: Speeding | Dangerous Driving | Property Damage</li>
        <li>Victim: Owner of damaged property | Mark and his group of friends in the vehicle</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="info"> During a Saturday night, an attempted street race happened between Mark and an unknown group of teenagers who had left the scene. This resulted in Mark crashing his vehicle. This crash caused minor injuries among Mark and his accomplices, but also damaged the front of a resident's house. The resulting damage was estimated to cost thousands of dollars. </p>
    <p class="info"> One key detail is that Mark has recently got his driver's license. With this information, we can safely assume that this was Mark's first time offense and that he is young enough to be charged under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (16 years or older in order to be eligible to recieve a Class 5 Graduated Driver's License). </p>
    <h2 class="mainpoint" id="topic2">The CRITERIA</h2>
    <h3 class="subheading" id="mark">Mark: </h3>
    <p class="info"> Mark is a young individual who committed a crime regarding property damage and speeding. As he just got his license, his <a href="#topic3" class="nava" style="color: #5C585A; text-decoration: underline">consequences</a> won't be as severe as a repeat offender. Since Mark is 16 years old, he is finishing up high school and severe consequences will definately affect his acedemic performance which will hurt him in the long run. In the crime, he also damaged his car which is also another burden he has to deal with.</p>
    <h3 class="subheading" id="victim">The Victim:</h3>
    <p class="info"> The victim of the crime had no idea that this was going to happen. With the property damages totalling over thousands of dollars, I feel that he/she should be fairly compensated. The victim's safety and security is also threatened as having a broken down house could lead to easier access for possible break and entries. </p>
    <h3 class="subheading" id="society">Society:</h3>
    <p class="info"> Giving fair and equitable consequences towards Mark will definately help out in the short and long-term. Mark will get to learn and grow from his mistakes and will be later rehabilitated and reintegrated back into society. His surrounding community will also get the safety benefit knowing that Mark is off the streets temporarily. If Mark were to be given a slap on the wrist, the chances of him learning from his mistakes are minimal. Since he knew he only got a minor penalty, there is a higher chance that he would do more wreckfull acts like these which will further endager his community and the surrounding area.</p>
    <h3 class="subheading" id="judicial">The Justice System:</h3>
    <p class="info">      
    The interests of the justice system is to provide a safe and secure society by treating everyone fair and equitably whilst being as cost effective. With this crime, the justice system would have an easy time formulating consequences. They need to make sure the victim's house is repaired and society is kept safe. They can do this by giving punishments towards Mark, but they need to make sure these punishments won't hinder his acedemic performance as he is in his final years of high school. It also shouldn't affect his job as his insurance is increasing and that he also needs to pay to repair his car. The crime also doesn't need to go to court, as it would cost time and money, and we already have sufficient evidence that Mark did it.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mainpoint" id="topic3">The CONSEQUENCES</h2>
    <p class="info">
    	As Mark caused several thousands of damages, the consequences should be severe; but we also have to take into account the circumstances that led to this crime. Mark is a teenager that recently got on the road. The excitement of driving on his own with his friends probably overshadowed the logical/decision making portion of his mind. This along with another group of teens provoking Mark to start a "street race" led to him committing property damage. When formulating his consequences, you also have to factor in that his own car is damaged and needs repairs also, and that he is in in final years of high school which are the most important years as it can decide your future.
    </p>
    <p class="info">
		Even though he caused tons of property damages, he shouldn't be charged as an adult. Instead, he should be charged under the YCJA as punishments from that act will allow Mark to grow from his mistakes and eventually be reintegrated back into society. His main punishment should be community service; it may be helping out rebuilding the damaged part of the victim's house or helping the victim with other tasks they need help with. I also feel that if Mark and the victim had a serious conversation, it would help Mark learn from his mistakes more that just facing jail time. Another consequence should be that his license be suspended until his 18 or be downgraded back to a learner's license until he is 18. This will prevent him from driving recklessly which would benefit him and the community.
	</p>
	<p class="info">
		These consequences that I've listed are no means perfect, but are a an outline of what the justice system should do. Mark can complete these consequences whilst staying in school so that his future won't be impacted. It also compensates the victim as Mark would help fund/participate in the repair of his house. The community around Mark will also feel much safer as Mark won't be driving on the streets or would be driving with a responsible adult. Since the crime won't go through court, it won't be expensive to fund these consequences which results in a win-win for the justice system and society.

        <h1>-The YCJA-</h1>
        <h3><i>Is It Effective?</i></h3>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
    <p class="info" style="margin-left: 0;">The Canadian Judicial System's main role in our society is to keep it under control. It keeps order and safety within our country. The judicial systems makes sure that laws are enforced and that a person's rights and freedoms are protected. It also makes sure that everyone is treated fairly and equitably. When it comes to a crime, the system tries its best to provide compensation to all parties (such as the victim, the offender, etc.).</p>
    <p class="info" style="margin-left: 0;">In 2003, the YCJA was introduced to provide alternate consequences to those between the ages of 12 to 17. This piece of legislation has been around for 14 years now it statitics have shown that it reduced youth crime rates.</p>
    <img src="graph.png" width="45%" style="display: inline-block; float: left;">
    <p class="info" style="margin-left: 0;">
    When the legistlation was passed in 2003, youth crime dropped significantly from its peak in 1991 (about a 56% decrease).
    </p>
    <p class="info" style="margin-left: 0;">
	I hypothesize that the cause of the drop in crime rate, is the core tenants of the YCJA. The YCJA provided young offenders consequences on a case-by-case basis that take into account a multitude of other circumstances. Punishments that were given out to young offenders are fair and allows the youth to focus on much other important aspects of their life such as school. These consequences usually range from community service, curfew, external counselling/support, and rehabilitation (getting to talk with the victim). It also ensures that the victim of the crime is fairly compensated for the result of the offender's actions. Although these consequences may sound like a slap on the wrist, they provide a great learning experience for the offender whilst also giving more time to put towards other commitments. 
	</p>
	<p class="info" style="margin-left: 0;">
	It is also not fair if a young offender was charged as an adult. Youth offenders have a lot of external forces and lack of knowledge which impedes their decision making. Giving adult sentences towards youth basically screws them over for life. When someone is charged under the YCJA, it gives them a mark on their criminal record which is then erased once they reach 18 (this is not the case for severe crimes). If given an adult sentence, that crime will forever stay on that person's criminal record. Having a criminal record greatly limits what you can do in the future. Most jobs out there require a clean criminal record, as well as many colleges, universities, and insitutions. In rare cases, you won't even be allowed to leave Canada with a criminal record. Allowing young offenders a clean criminal record once they reach 18 greatly openes up their options for their future which can definately benefit them and society as a whole.
	</p>
	<p class="info" style="margin-left: 0;">
	Overall, I feel that the YCJA is an effective piece of legislation. Overtime, it has shown that youth crime rates have decreased and it provides youth the meaningful consequences that allows them to learn from their mistakes. The alternate consequences it provides far outweights adult sentences. If young offenders were treated like adults, their futures would have been ripped apart from them, and adult sentences don't factor all the other external forces that can affect a youth's mind.
